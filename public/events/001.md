# “FLAGGED: INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK! LABORERS/SECURITY REQUIRED, CC ALL RESPONSES TO CHIEF ENGINEER CASTOR FIELDING.”
Evergreen’s landing bowl is flooded and Chief Engineer Fielding needs an escort to help him install a pump system to keep it drained through the wet season. If Evergreen is to grow as a colony, it needs the infrastructure to support offworld trade via terrestrial launch. The bowl is how the only way to safely launch vessels close to the colony.

The bowl is a few kilometers southeast of Evergreen. In the wet season the gravel road is prone to flooding and washouts, a pain to navigate – not dangerous, but slow. 

However, with raiders in the area – whoever they are – transporting the necessary materials and personnel to install the automated pumps is perilous. Fielding needs a militia escort at minimum, but an escort of mechs and militia would be best.
